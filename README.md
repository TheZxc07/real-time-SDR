## Real-time SDR for mono/stereo FM and RDS

The main objective of the project is to navigate a complex speciÔ¨Åcation and develop an understanding of the challenges that must be addressed for a real-time implementation of a computing system operating in a form factor-constrained environment. 

The project description is available in the project [document](doc/3dy4-project-2024.pdf). The unique constraints for each group for different modes of operation (i.e., custom sample rates) are available [here](doc/3dy4-constraints-group-0.pdf).

All the project source code must be submitted before 7 p.m. on March 28. The project cross-examinations and oral presentations will run in the week of April 1, and the detailed final project report is due before 7 p.m. on April 5. 

Hello Grading Team,

In this Repo, we have our compiled effort for our SDR. 

We have accomplished the following sections:

MONO: All modes complete in src

STEREO: All modes complete in src

RDS: MODE 0 Works to acquire PTY and PI consistently, Mode 2 is far less consistent
program service is far less consistent in both modes

In Python, RDS has been modelled completely (given a strong signal, like samples3 or samples8) in OurRDS.py
We used some algorithms from PySDR for frame sync, and scipy libraries to supplement or signal processing
